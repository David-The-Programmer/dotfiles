# Setup guide for Git

**Note, this is my own setup for using Git with HTTPs**

Will be using [git-credential-manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager)
Will be using GPG/pass compatible files method to store the git credentials, as described [here](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/docs/credstores.md)

Packages that need to be installed
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
- [git-credential-manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager)

Take note when installing the git-credential-manager, use the command 
```sh
yay -S git-credential-manager-core-bin
```
TODO: Document exact configuration steps here after installation
